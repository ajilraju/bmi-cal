# BMI (ody Mass Index)
Body Mass Index calculator
--------------------------
The body mass index or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass and height of an individual.

You are to write a Java console application that calculates and classifies BMI (Body Mass Index) for individuals. The number of individuals (N) is fixed at 10, so it should be declared as final int N = 10 in your program.

BMI is calculated using the following equation:

BMI = weight / (height*height)

where weight is in kilograms and height is in metres.
